# Adobe Illustrator graphics

To embed Adobe Illustrator graphics in Svelte components, we use a modified version of the [ai2html](http://ai2html.org/) script, which can be found in our [ai2svelte](https://github.com/reuters-graphics/ai2svelte/) repo.

Copy the [ai2svelte.js](https://github.com/reuters-graphics/ai2svelte/blob/master/ai2svelte.js) script into the Illustrator folder where scripts are located.
